# Obesity Risk Classification Supervised ML Project

## Overview
This repository hosts a supervised machine learning project focused on classifying the risk of obesity based on various factors. Leveraging datasets containing features such as diet, physical activity, demographics, and medical history, the project aims to develop predictive models that can accurately categorize individuals into different obesity risk classes.

## Goals
- **Obesity Risk Assessment:** Develop models to accurately predict obesity risk levels based on input features.
- **Feature Analysis:** Investigate the importance of different features in determining obesity risk.
- **Model Evaluation:** Compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms in classifying obesity risk.
